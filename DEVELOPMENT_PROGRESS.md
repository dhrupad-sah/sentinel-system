# Autonomous GitHub Issue Resolution System - Development Progress

## Project Overview
An autonomous tool that picks GitHub issues, uses Claude Code CLI to work on them, and creates PRs automatically with human oversight.

## System Architecture

### Core Workflow (v1 - Event-Driven)
1. **Issue Discovery**: GitHub webhooks trigger instantly when labels are added/removed
2. **AI Analysis**: Claude Code CLI analyzes issue and proposes solution 
3. **Human Review Loop**: Human reviews/approves AI proposal via GitHub labels
4. **Implementation**: AI implements approved solution (triggered by webhook)
5. **Git Workflow**: Auto-commit, branch creation, PR submission, and issue closure

## Version Planning

### v0 - MVP (Completed âœ…)
**Scope**: Simple single-threaded approach with scheduler-based polling
- âœ… Single chat session for all issues (process one issue at a time)
- âœ… Basic GitHub integration (issue fetching, commenting, labeling)
- âœ… Simple human approval workflow
- âœ… Basic git operations (commit, branch, push, PR)
- âœ… Configuration via settings file
- âœ… Scheduler-based issue polling
- âœ… Complete end-to-end workflow with automatic issue closure

**Key Decisions for v0**:
- âœ… Process issues sequentially (no parallel processing)
- âœ… Single Claude Code CLI chat session
- âœ… Wait for current issue completion before picking next
- âœ… Simple label-based approval system
- âœ… Polling-based issue detection

### v1 - Event-Driven Architecture (Current Target ðŸ”„)
**Major Upgrade**: Replace polling with real-time webhooks
- **ðŸ”„ GitHub Webhooks Integration**: Real-time event-driven processing
  - Replace scheduler polling with instant webhook triggers
  - Process issues immediately when labels are added/removed
  - Webhook signature verification for security
  - Background task processing for async handling
- **ðŸ”„ System Cleanup**: Remove scheduler-related components
  - Remove SchedulerService and scheduler router
  - Keep manual trigger endpoints for testing/debugging
  - Streamline codebase and reduce complexity
- **ðŸ”„ Enhanced Performance**: Instant response times

- [ ] **Enhanced Error Handling**: Robust fallback mechanisms
- [ ] **Metrics & Monitoring**: Track success rates, processing times

### v2 - Advanced Features
**Future Considerations**:

- [ ] **Multi-repo Support**: Handle issues across multiple repositories
- [ ] **Smart Issue Prioritization**: AI-driven issue selection
- [ ] **Integration with CI/CD**: Automated deployment pipeline
- [ ] **Advanced Human Review**: Web interface for proposal review

## Technical Decisions

### GitHub Integration (v1 - Webhook-Driven)
- **GitHub Webhooks**: Real-time event processing for instant responses
- **GitHub REST API**: For issue management, commenting, and labeling
- **Webhook Events**: Listen for `issues.labeled` and `issues.unlabeled` events
- **Security**: Webhook signature verification using GitHub secret
- **Labels for workflow state management**:
  - `ai-ready` - Issues ready for AI processing (triggers analysis)
  - `ai-proposal-pending` - AI has proposed solution, awaiting human review
  - `ai-approved` - Human has approved AI's proposal (triggers implementation)
  - `ai-working` - AI is currently implementing solution

### Event Processing Architecture
- **Async Processing**: Background tasks for webhook event handling
- **Quick Response**: Return 200 OK immediately to prevent GitHub retries
- **Idempotent Processing**: Handle duplicate webhooks gracefully
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery with GitHub's built-in retry mechanism

### AI Integration
- Claude Code CLI already configured in target repository
- No git cloning needed (works within existing repo)
- AI adds comments to issues for transparency
- Background task processing prevents blocking webhook responses

### Human Review Process
- AI posts proposal as GitHub issue comment
- Human reviews and either approves or requests changes via labels
- Webhook instantly triggers next phase when approval label added
- Iterative refinement until approval received

## Configuration Requirements
- Target repository settings
- GitHub API credentials
- Issue label configurations
- Claude Code CLI setup verification
- Scheduling parameters
- Docker deployment environment
- GitHub Container Registry access

## Risk Mitigation
- Human approval required before any code changes
- All AI actions logged as GitHub comments
- Git branch isolation for each issue
- Rollback capabilities
