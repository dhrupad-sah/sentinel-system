# Autonomous GitHub Issue Resolution System - Development Progress

## Project Overview
An autonomous tool that picks GitHub issues, uses Gemini CLI to work on them, and creates PRs automatically with human oversight.

## System Architecture

### Core Workflow
1. **Issue Discovery**: Scheduled process monitors GitHub repo for issues with specific label
2. **AI Analysis**: Gemini CLI analyzes issue and proposes solution 
3. **Human Review Loop**: Human reviews/approves AI proposal via GitHub labels
4. **Implementation**: AI implements approved solution
5. **Git Workflow**: Auto-commit, branch creation, and PR submission

## Version Planning

### v0 - MVP (Current Target)
**Scope**: Simple single-threaded approach
- Single chat session for all issues (process one issue at a time)
- Basic GitHub integration (issue fetching, commenting, labeling)
- Simple human approval workflow
- Basic git operations (commit, branch, push, PR)
- Configuration via settings file

**Key Decisions for v0**:
- âœ… Process issues sequentially (no parallel processing)
- âœ… Single Gemini CLI chat session
- âœ… Wait for current issue completion before picking next
- âœ… Simple label-based approval system

### v1 - Enhanced Features
**Planned Enhancements**:
- [ ] **Separate Chat Threads**: Each issue gets its own isolated Gemini chat session
  - Prevents context bleeding between issues
  - Enables parallel issue processing
  - Better context preservation per issue
- [ ] **Parallel Processing**: Handle multiple issues simultaneously
- [ ] **Enhanced Error Handling**: Robust fallback mechanisms
- [ ] **Metrics & Monitoring**: Track success rates, processing times
- [ ] **Advanced Configuration**: More granular settings

### v2 - Advanced Features
**Future Considerations**:
- [ ] **Automated Testing**: Run tests before creating PR
- [ ] **Multi-repo Support**: Handle issues across multiple repositories
- [ ] **Smart Issue Prioritization**: AI-driven issue selection
- [ ] **Integration with CI/CD**: Automated deployment pipeline
- [ ] **Advanced Human Review**: Web interface for proposal review

## Current Development Status

### Completed
- [x] Project architecture design
- [x] Development roadmap creation
- [x] PDM project setup with dependencies
- [x] FastAPI application structure
- [x] Configuration management (Pydantic Settings)
- [x] API router structure (health, github, scheduler)
- [x] GitHub service implementation
- [x] Health check endpoints
- [x] Environment configuration example
- [x] Comprehensive README documentation
- [x] Gemini CLI service implementation (using authenticated CLI)
- [x] Issue processor service (complete workflow orchestration)
- [x] Git service implementation (branch management, commits, pushes)
- [x] Scheduler service implementation (automated processing)
- [x] Updated health checks with service integration

### In Progress
- [x] Testing and validation of complete workflow
- [x] Error handling improvements (git stashing, phase separation)
- [x] Fixed premature code implementation during analysis phase
- [x] Automatic issue closure after PR creation
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Enhanced logging and monitoring

### Next Steps
1. âœ… ~~Set up project structure~~
2. âœ… ~~Implement GitHub API integration~~
3. âœ… ~~Complete Gemini CLI integration service~~
4. âœ… ~~Create basic issue processing workflow~~
5. âœ… ~~Implement scheduler service~~
6. âœ… ~~Add git operations service~~
7. ðŸ”„ Testing and refinement
8. ðŸ”„ Create environment file and configure settings
9. ðŸ”„ Test complete end-to-end workflow
10. ðŸ”„ Add monitoring and logging improvements

## Technical Decisions

### GitHub Integration
- Use GitHub REST API for issue management
- Labels for workflow state management:
  - `ai-ready` - Issues ready for AI processing
  - `ai-proposal-pending` - AI has proposed solution, awaiting human review
  - `ai-approved` - Human has approved AI's proposal
  - `ai-working` - AI is currently implementing solution

### AI Integration
- Gemini CLI already configured in target repository
- No git cloning needed (works within existing repo)
- AI adds comments to issues for transparency

### Human Review Process
- AI posts proposal as GitHub issue comment
- Human reviews and either approves or requests changes
- Iterative refinement until approval received

## Configuration Requirements
- Target repository settings
- GitHub API credentials
- Issue label configurations
- Gemini CLI setup verification
- Scheduling parameters

## Risk Mitigation
- Human approval required before any code changes
- All AI actions logged as GitHub comments
- Git branch isolation for each issue
- Rollback capabilities
